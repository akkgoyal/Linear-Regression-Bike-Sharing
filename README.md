## Business Understanding
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
> In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Business Objectives
> The company wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Data Understanding
> We are using Bike Sharing Data Set. It contains the complete data of different factors on which the bike demand depends for the year 2018 and 2019.
> We are also referring the data dictionary which describes the meaning of these variables.

> The aformentioned files are present inside this repository as:
1. day.csv
2. Readme.csv (It contains the data dictionary)
